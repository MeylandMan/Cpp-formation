#include <iostream> //iostream = in-out stream

//Creating a console is way different from C#
//std = standard; cout = console? out

//Instead of using dot for referencing a variable in a specific class, we use ::

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Welcome to the console." << std::endl;
}
